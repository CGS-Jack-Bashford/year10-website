^.^|*A*
.^|
The student demonstrates an extensive knowledge of cybersecurity and penetration testing – particularly towards common web-based vulnerabilities and exploits relating to Linux permissions, authentication, code execution, various injection attacks, and cross-site scripting. They are also skilled at assessing and enumerating systems for vulnerabilities and potential attack vectors. They have the skills to do more complex information reconnaissance through means such as packet capture and are able to interpret such collected data. Presented with a scenario or exercise, the student is able to call upon their knowledge to determine the most suitable techniques and tools to apply towards addressing that particular challenge.
^.^|*B*

The student demonstrates a thorough knowledge of cybersecurity and penetration testing – particularly towards common web-based vulnerabilities and exploits relating to Linux permissions, authentication, code execution, various injection attacks, and cross-site scripting. They are also skilled at assessing and enumerating systems for vulnerabilities and potential attack vectors. They have the skills to do information reconnaissance through means such as packet capture and are able to understand such collected data. Presented with a scenario or exercise, the student is able to call upon their knowledge to determine techniques and tools which could be applied towards addressing that particular challenge. To improve, they should further practice applying their knowledge to practical exploitation activities, providing them with the opportunity to refine their practical and technical problem-solving skills.
^.^|*C*
.^|
The student demonstrates a sound knowledge of cybersecurity and penetration testing – with a working understanding of common web-based vulnerabilities and exploits relating to Linux permissions, authentication, code execution, various injection attacks, and cross-site scripting. They are able to assess and enumerate systems for well-known vulnerabilities and attack vectors. They have the skills to do information reconnaissance through means such as packet capture but have limited ability to interpret such collected data. Presented with a scenario or exercise, the student is able to call upon their knowledge to determine some techniques and tools which could be applied towards addressing that particular challenge. To improve, they should further practice applying their knowledge to practical exploitation activities. Additionally, the student should also conduct revision of the tools and techniques learned, how they technically work, and what kind of scenarios those could be applied towards.
^.^|*D*
.^|
The student demonstrates a limited knowledge of cybersecurity and penetration testing – with only a basic understanding of common web-based vulnerabilities and exploits relating to Linux permissions, authentication, code execution, various injection attacks, and cross-site scripting. They have a basic ability to assess and enumerate systems for vulnerabilities and attack vectors. While they understand the purpose of information reconnaissance means such as packet capture they have limited ability to interpret such collected data. Presented with a scenario or exercise, the student has difficultly determining techniques and tools which could be applied towards addressing that particular challenge. To improve, they should further practice applying their knowledge to practical exploitation activities. Additionally, the student should also conduct revision of the tools and techniques learned, how they technically work, and what kind of scenarios those could be applied towards.
^.^|*E*
.^|
The student demonstrates a very limited knowledge of cybersecurity and penetration testing – with little understanding of common web-based vulnerabilities and exploits relating to Linux permissions, authentication, code execution, various injection attacks, and cross-site scripting. They encounter significant difficulties in assessing and enumerating systems for vulnerabilities and attack vectors. While they understand the purpose of information reconnaissance means such as packet capture they are unable to interpret such collected data. Presented with a scenario or exercise, the student has difficultly determining techniques and tools which could be applied towards addressing that particular challenge. To improve, they should further practice applying their knowledge to practical exploitation activities. Additionally, the student should also conduct revision of the tools and techniques learned, how they technically work, and what kind of scenarios those could be applied towards.
